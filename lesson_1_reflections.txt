How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

	1. You can see the different changes.
	2. If there is an error you would probably know how to solve it faster.


What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do i Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?
	
	1. One pro about manually creating a commit is that you have the ability to choose when you want to commit, how big & small you want the commits to be.
	2. On the other hand since you are manually having to commit, you might forget to commit from time to time.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

	1. I think some version control systems are used in different ways, based upon what project you are working on. Git if your working on a project with code & Google Docs would be used on idea generation etc etc.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

	1. You can see what changes have been made & also see the differences between each changes.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

	1. You now know how to revert back to changes and figure out how to fix any bugs.
